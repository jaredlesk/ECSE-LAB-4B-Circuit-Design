## How it works

Manual clock. 4 Flip flops and 3 or gates. Each clock tick pushes the input to the next flip flop.
## How to test

Hit your input and tick the clock. This will pass the input to the first flip flop. Then hit the your next input and push tick the clock and all inputs will shift down one flip-flop. 

## External hardware

We used LEDs to display the ticking output and display the stored input in each flip flop after each clock tick.
